# classify-run.sh — decide, once, whether the reviewer actually completed.
#
# Usage:
#   classify-run.sh --execution-file FILE [--verdict-out FILE]
#
# Prints a human-readable line and writes one word — `completed` or
# `unavailable` — to --verdict-out. It never fails the job.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. review.yml used to branch on `steps.claude.outcome`: summary
# on success, "review unavailable" on failure. That reads the action's exit
# code, and the action's exit code is not the same question as "did the review
# happen". `claude-code-action` validates the turn count AFTER the run and fails
# the step when `num_turns` exceeds `--max-turns`, even when the CLI itself
# reported success:
#
#   {"type":"result","subtype":"success","is_error":false,"num_turns":43,
#    "terminal_reason":"completed","total_cost_usd":0.87}
#   ##[error]Claude reported a successful result after 43 turns, exceeding the
#            configured maximum of 40
#
# That is Aileaneprod/korbyx#110, run 34058925818. A finished review, five
# minutes and $0.87 of it, was announced to the author as "AI review
# unavailable" and thrown away. The action writes the execution file BEFORE it
# runs that assertion — 20:50:22.4330005Z against 20:50:22.4373406Z — so the
# evidence of success is on disk while the step goes red.
#
# The decision is computed HERE, once, and both later steps read the result. A
# GitHub `if:` expression cannot read a file, so the alternative — two steps
# each doing their own shell test — would let the two drift apart and produce
# the two failure modes that matter: both branches speaking, or neither.
#
# WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CLAIM. A `success` result record does not prove
# the findings reached GitHub. The action buffers inline comments and flushes
# them in a later step, which starts ~9 ms after the execution file is written,
# so no field in that file can witness the flush. This script answers "did the
# reviewer finish", nothing more. Whether anything was actually POSTED is
# decided downstream by post-review.sh, which is the only thing that knows —
# and the "unavailable" notice keys off that, not off this verdict.
#
# Requires: python3.
