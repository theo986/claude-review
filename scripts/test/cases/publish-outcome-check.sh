# publish-outcome-check.sh — the only thing that changes what a reviewer SEES.
#
# Every other signal this workflow emits on the unavailable path (the step
# summary, the annotation, the notice comment) was already there while
# Aileaneprod/korbyx#131 was merged believing a review had run. So the cases
# below are about the two ways this one could fail quietly in the same manner:
#
#   * a denied API call that reads as a success, leaving the check green and
#     nobody told which permission is missing;
#   * a second check run stacked on the first, which is the defect the notice
#     comment already has and must not be copied into the check.
#
# `gh` is an exported shell function, not a file on PATH — same reason as
# post-review.sh's case file: no executable bit to lose, and `command -v gh`
# finds a function.
